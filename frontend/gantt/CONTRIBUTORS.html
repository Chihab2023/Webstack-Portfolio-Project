        <p>Welcome Contributor
=</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time examining and potentially modifying the source code. I truly believe it is what makes this community so great. This plugin wouldn&#39;t have gained the notoriety it has had I not opened up the original source and been quite unhappy with it.</p>
<p>Requirements &amp; Best Practices
-</p>
<p>Just a few guidelines before submitting issues and pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the code passes <a href="http://jshint.com">JSHint</a> completely</li>
<li>Always strive to write code that meets <a href="http://taitems.github.com/Front-End-Development-Guidelines/">best practices</a></li>
<li>If you&#39;re attempting to solve a very unique bug, a test case is preferred</li>
<li>Please target all pull requests to the <a href="/../../tree/master">master</a> branch</li>
</ul>
<p>And thanks once again!</p>
